  <h1>Nubank is hiring a Software Engineer</h1>

<div id="detail">

<h2>What is Nubank?</h2>
<p>Nubank is an early stage, technology-driven financial services startup funded by Sequoia Capital and Kaszek Ventures. We are building a truly global and diverse team, with people who are in the top of their areas of expertise for every position we hire, to set the new standard in financial services in Brazil. We see a significant opportunity in the credit card market in Brazil as it is currently commoditized and extremely inefficient, and therefore our first product is a credit card controlled by a mobile app, that also provides our customers full control of their finances on their mobile phones.  We are based in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<h2>Why is software engineering important for us?</h2>
<p>Nubank is a technology company, and software engineers form the bulk of our team.  Our software team creates new features for our cardholder customers, as well as advanced analytics and machine learning models to continuously improve decision making and streamline processes.</p>

<h2>What are some examples of problems a software engineer will solve?</h2>
<p>Shipping valuable features requires close coordination between devops, database, API, and frontend workstreams; Nubank engineers commonly pair and rotate focus between these responsibilities.  We consistently work with new technologies, and thus value professionals who are open to learning new things, regardless of pre-existing comfort zones.  Nubank software engineers might solve any of the following problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create interactive visualizations for live streaming data sets</li>
  <li>Integrate data pipelines to drive underwriting decisions</li>
  <li>Triage bugs and exceptions reported in production</li>
  <li>Implement budgeting tools to help customers better understand their spending</li>
  <li>Create intelligent monitors for key customer experiences and risk-relevant events</li>
  <li>Measure and optimize API performance</li>
  <li>Conduct system load / stress tests</li>
</ul>

<h2>You will fit well if</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You thrive in dynamic, fast-paced, results oriented teams</li>
  <li>You are hungry and enjoy being constantly challenged to learn and do more</li>
  <li>You embrace conflict of ideas and like to question the status quo</li>
  <li>You learn fast and easily adapt to changing situations and priorities</li>
  <li>You believe in building great products and doing great work</li>
  <li>You want to understand the big picture, to be held accountable and make a meaningful contribution with your work</li>
</ul>


<h2>Relevant skills</h2>
<p>We are excited to meet experienced coders with various areas of technical focus - there is no single ideal profile. We all wear multiple hats and cannot be experts in everything at once.</p>

<h3>Relevant backend experiences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modern web frameworks (Ring, Django, Rails, Sinatra, Express)</li>
  <li>RESTful API oriented design / modular service oriented architecture</li>
  <li>Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Resque, Sidekiq)</li>
  <li>Functional programming (Clojure, Scala, Haskell, ML, Scheme, Erlang)</li>
  <li>JVM experience (Java, Scala, JRuby, Clojure)</li>
  <li>SQL / NoSQL databases (Datomic, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL)</li>
  <li>Automated unit / functional / integration testing</li>
  <li>Infrastructure as code (e.g., Docker, Chef, Puppet, Ansible)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relevant frontend experiences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Browser-based single page applications: React, Angular, Backbone, Ember</li>
  <li>JavaScript / Coffeescript / ClojureScript, HTML, CSS</li>
  <li>Modern front end workflow, including Bower, Grunt, Gulp, etc.</li>
  <li>Interactive data visualization (e.g., d3.js, crossfilter)</li>
  <li>Automated testing (e.g., Jasmine, Karma, Mocha)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have a meaningful chance to shape architecture, process, and culture while working with bleeding edge technologies.  We believe in good team chemistry, enthusiasm for building things, and our surprising capacity to learn new things when we stay humble and open-minded.  An engineering undergraduate degree and English language skills are helpful.</p>


<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Competitive compensation package</li>
  <li>Health, dental and life insurance</li>
  <li>Meal allowance (“vale refeição”)</li>
  <li>Flexibility to choose your own custom setup (computer, monitors, OS etc.)</li>
