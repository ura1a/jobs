  <h1>Nubank is hiring a Lead Frontend Developer</h1>

<div id="detail">

    <p>We are a technology-driven financial startup funded by Sequoia Capital and Kaszek Ventures and based in Sao Paulo. We are looking for a Lead Frontend Developer with real experience working on the cutting edge of what is possible in a modern browser. You will lead our web frontend efforts as we seek to completely redesign and rethink financial services, one of the largest and least innovative sectors in Brazil.</p>

    <h2>Desired skills and experience:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ambitious single page applications (e.g., Angular, Ember, Backbone, React) in JavaScript/Coffeescript and CSS3</li>
      <li>Modern front end workflows like Yeoman.io</li>
      <li>Interactive data visualization (e.g., d3.js)</li>
      <li>Automated testing (e.g., Jasmine, Karma, Mocha)</li>
      <li>Frontend performance profiling and optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You will experience an early stage startup culture in a truly diverse and international environment. You have a unique opportunity to shape product, process, and culture as we build a company on the leading edge of design and technology.  We believe in good team chemistry, flat hierarchy, enthusiasm for creating things, and our surprising capacity to learn new things when we stay humble and open-minded.</p>

    <p>An ideal candidate would be able to relocate to work with us in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but we are open to remote arrangements for talented individuals.</p>

    <p>To apply, email <a target='_new' href='mailto:jobs@nubank.com.br'>jobs@nubank.com.br</a> with a CV, Github Account, or LinkedIn profile to give us a sense for your experience and capabilities.</p>
